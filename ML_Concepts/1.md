# Multiclass vs Multi-Label Classification

| Feature                | **Multiclass Classification** | **Multi-Label Classification** |
|------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Definition**         | Each instance belongs to **one and only one** class. | Each instance can belong to **multiple classes** simultaneously. |
| **Number of Labels per Instance** | **Exactly one** label per instance. | **One or more** labels per instance. |
| **Example Use Case**   | **Handwritten digit recognition** (classifying a digit as 0–9). | **Movie genre classification** (a movie can be labeled as Action, Comedy, and Sci-Fi). |
| **Output Format**      | Single class label per instance (e.g., `"Cat"`). | A list of multiple class labels per instance (e.g., `["Action", "Drama"]`). |
| **Model Output (Neural Networks)** | **Softmax activation** (each class gets a probability, and the highest one is selected). | **Sigmoid activation** (each class has an independent probability thresholded to assign multiple labels). |
| **Loss Function**      | **Categorical Cross-Entropy** (compares predicted probability distribution with the true class). | **Binary Cross-Entropy** (each class is treated as an independent binary classification problem). |
| **Algorithm Examples** | One-vs-All (OvA), One-vs-One (OvO), Softmax-based classifiers, Decision Trees, SVM, Naïve Bayes. | Multi-label adaptations of Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM, and Neural Networks with Sigmoid activation. |
| **Evaluation Metrics** | **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Log Loss.** | **Hamming Loss, Precision@K, Mean Average Precision, Micro/Macro F1-score, Jaccard Similarity.** |
| **Handling Ambiguity** | No ambiguity—model always chooses a single class. | Handles ambiguous cases where an instance belongs to multiple categories. |
| **Real-World Example** | **Email spam classification** (Spam or Not Spam). | **Text tagging** (A news article can be tagged as "Politics", "Economy", and "World News"). |
