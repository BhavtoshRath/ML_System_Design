## Model Compression

Model compression techniques are methods used to reduce the size of a machine learning model while attempting to preserve its accuracy and performance. These techniques are particularly useful for deploying models on devices with limited resources (e.g., mobile phones, embedded systems), improving inference speed, and reducing memory usage.

## Ensemble Methods
Ensemble methods are machine learning techniques that combine multiple models to improve performance,
increase accuracy, and reduce overfitting. Instead of relying on a single model, ensemble methods 
aggregate predictions from multiple models to produce a more robust and generalizable outcome.

Types of Ensemble Methods

## Stacking

**Stacking** (also called **Stacked Generalization**) is an ensemble learning technique that combines 
multiple machine learning models to improve overall performance by leveraging the strengths of each model.
Unlike other ensemble methods like **bagging** and **boosting**, which aggregate predictions of the same 
type of model, **stacking** `involves training different types of models` and learning how to best combine 
their predictions using a `meta-model`.

### **Steps Involved in Stacking:**
1. **Train Base Models**: Train different models on the same training data.
2. **Generate Predictions for Meta-Model**: For each instance in the training set, generate predictions from the base models (using a validation set or cross-validation).
3. **Train Meta-Model**: Train a meta-model (often a simple model like logistic regression, but it can be more complex) on the base model predictions.
4. **Make Final Predictions**: During inference, the base models make predictions, which are then used as input features to the meta-model, and the meta-model outputs the final prediction.

### **Example:**
Suppose you're solving a classification problem (e.g., predicting whether a customer will churn or not), and you decide to use stacking to combine multiple base models like:
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The steps would look like this:
1. **Train Base Models**: Train the Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM on the training data.
2. **Generate Predictions for Meta-Model**: Use cross-validation to generate predictions from each of these base models for the training data.
3. **Train Meta-Model**: Take the predictions from each base model as features and train a meta-model (e.g., logistic regression) on these features to predict the final outcome.
4. **Final Prediction**: For a new test instance, the base models predict the outcome, and the meta-model combines these predictions to give the final classification.

### **Advantages of Stacking:**
- **Improved Performance**: By combining multiple models, stacking can often outperform any single model, especially if the base models are diverse and make different types of errors.
- **Flexibility**: You can use different types of models as base learners, making it highly flexible and powerful for complex tasks.
- **Handles Complex Data**: It’s particularly effective in problems with complex, high-dimensional data (e.g., tabular data, image data with features extracted, etc.).

### **Disadvantages of Stacking:**
- **Computationally Expensive**: Stacking requires training multiple base models and a meta-model, which can be computationally expensive, especially if the models are complex.
- **Overfitting Risk**: If not properly cross-validated, stacking can lead to overfitting since the meta-model is trained on predictions from base models, which might have already been overfitted on the training data.
- **Requires More Data**: Stacking works best when you have a large amount of data to train all the models without overfitting.

### **Common Meta-Models:**
- **Logistic Regression**: Commonly used in stacking as the meta-model because it's simple and effective in combining base model outputs.
- **Linear Models**: Sometimes a linear model like **Ridge Regression** or **Lasso** is used as the meta-model.
- **Decision Trees** or **Random Forests**: More complex meta-models can be used, especially when the relationship between base model predictions is non-linear.

### **Summary:**
- **Stacking** combines multiple models to create a more powerful model.
- The key idea is to train a meta-model on the predictions of base models.
- **Base models** can be any machine learning algorithm, and the **meta-model** is typically a simple model like logistic regression.
- **Advantages**: Increases accuracy, combines different model strengths.
- **Disadvantages**: Computationally intensive, risk of overfitting without proper validation.
