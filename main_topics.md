# üß† ML System Design Interview Framework

## üìå Overview  
Machine Learning (ML) system design interviews test your ability to design **scalable, efficient, and reliable ML-driven systems**.  
This guide provides a **structured problem-solving framework** to tackle ML system design questions effectively.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Problem Understanding & Scope Definition**  
‚úÖ **Clarify the problem statement:**  
   - What is the **goal** of the ML system? (e.g., recommendation, classification, forecasting)  
   - Who are the **end users**, and how will they interact with the system?  
   - What are the key **business objectives** and success metrics? 
   - Any constraints?

‚úÖ **Ask clarifying questions:**

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Pipeline & Feature Engineering**  
‚úÖ **Data collection and sources:**  
   - What **data sources** are available? (Logs, databases, APIs, user interactions)  
   - Do we have labeled data, or do we need **human labeling**?  

‚úÖ **Data preprocessing & storage:**  
   - How do we handle **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**?  
   - Where will the data be stored? (SQL, NoSQL, Data Lake, Feature Store)  

‚úÖ **Feature engineering:**  
   - What are the most relevant features?  
   - How do we handle **missing values, outliers, and categorical data**?  
   - Do we need **real-time feature extraction** or batch processing?  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection & Training Strategy**  
‚úÖ **Model choices:**  
   - Will we use **supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning**?  
   - What `baseline models` can we start with? (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Transformer-based models)  
   - Will we use **pre-trained models** or train from scratch? 
   - Possibility of continual learning ?

‚úÖ **Training considerations:**  
   - How do we handle **data imbalance** and prevent overfitting? 
   - Sampling strategies
   - What loss functions and evaluation metrics are appropriate?  
   - Training from scratch vs. fine-tuning
   - Should we use **distributed training (e.g., PyTorch DDP, TensorFlow Mirrored Strategy)**?  

‚úÖ **Hyperparameter tuning:**  
   - Will we use **Grid Search, Random Search, or Bayesian Optimization**?  
   - How do we balance **model complexity vs. interpretability**?  

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Model Deployment & Serving Strategy**  
‚úÖ **Model inference approach:**  
   - Will it be **batch inference, online inference, or hybrid**?  
   - Do we need **low latency (real-time predictions)** or is batch processing sufficient?  

‚úÖ **Infrastructure choices:**  
   - Where will the model be deployed? (On-prem, Cloud, Edge)  
   - Will we use **Docker, Kubernetes, or serverless functions**?  
   - Should we use a **model-serving framework (TF Serving, TorchServe, NVIDIA Triton)?**  

‚úÖ **Scaling considerations:**  
   - How will we handle **traffic spikes and load balancing**?  
   - Do we need **multi-model A/B testing (check stat-sig) or canary deployments (roll out new model to small subset of users)**? 
   - Model compression


**How to measure statistical significance in  A/B Testing?**
- Using statistical hypothesis tests such as two-sample t-test or chi-squared test.
- Two-sample test example: Suppose from the test we get the result had model A is better than model B with p-value
=0.05 (5%), and we define stat-sig as p<=0.05 (meaning, that if we run the test 100 times, 95 time model A outperforms model
B).

### **Using Bandits for A/B Testing**  

Traditional **A/B testing** splits traffic equally between variants (A and B) and waits for statistical 
significance. However, this **wastes traffic** on underperforming variants. **Multi-Armed Bandits (MABs)** solve this by dynamically allocating traffic to better-performing options, reducing regret (loss from suboptimal choices).  

### **Key Bandit Algorithms for A/B Testing**  

#### **1. Epsilon-Greedy**  
- **How it Works:**  
  - With probability **Œµ (explore)**, pick a random variant.  
  - With probability **(1 - Œµ) (exploit)**, choose the best-performing variant so far.  
- **Best for:** Simple scenarios, when exploration-exploitation balance is needed.  

#### **2. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)**  
- **How it Works:**  
  - Select the variant with the highest **upper confidence bound** on expected reward.  
  - More **exploration early**, then prioritizes the best option.  
- **Best for:** Ensuring minimal regret in high-stakes decisions.  

#### **3. Thompson Sampling (Bayesian Approach)**  
- **How it Works:**  
  - Models rewards as **probability distributions** (Beta distribution for Bernoulli rewards).  
  - Samples from these distributions and selects the variant with the highest sampled value.  
  - Naturally balances **exploration and exploitation** based on uncertainty.  
- **Best for:** Adaptive A/B testing with uncertain prior knowledge.  


### **Example: Bandit-Based A/B Testing for Ad Ranking**  
**Scenario:**  
Etsy wants to test **two ad ranking models**:  
- **Model A** (current ranking)  
- **Model B** (new ranking with personalization)  

#### **Traditional A/B Testing Approach:**  
- Split traffic **50/50** ‚Üí Lose revenue if B is worse.  
- Wait weeks for statistical significance.  

#### **Bandit Approach (Thompson Sampling):**  
- **Phase 1 (Exploration):** Both models get traffic, but allocation adjusts dynamically.  
- **Phase 2 (Exploitation):** If Model B performs better, it gets **more traffic automatically**.  
- **Result:** Faster convergence, **less revenue loss**, and improved user experience.  

#### **Advantages of Bandit-Based A/B Testing:**  
‚úÖ **Reduces regret** ‚Äì Less time spent on bad variants.  
‚úÖ **Faster decision-making** ‚Äì Adapts in real time.  
‚úÖ **Works well in dynamic environments** ‚Äì Handles shifting user behavior.
