### **🔹 Inputs vs. Outputs in an ML System**  

| **Inputs (Data & Features)** | **Outputs (Predictions & Actions)** |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **🔹 Data Understanding & Selection**<br>✅ What types of data are needed? (Structured/Unstructured)<br>✅ What are the key **features** that impact performance?<br>✅ How do you handle **missing, noisy, or imbalanced** data? | **🔹 Prediction & Actionable Insights**<br>✅ What type of output does the model generate? (Class label, Probability, Regression)<br>✅ Should the model provide **uncertainty estimates**?<br>✅ How should the system handle **edge cases & outliers**? |
| **🔹 Data Volume & Velocity**<br>✅ How much **historical data** is required for training?<br>✅ How do you handle **large-scale data ingestion** efficiently?<br>✅ Should the model rely on **real-time streaming** or **batch data**? | **🔹 Output Format & Consumer Requirements**<br>✅ What format should the output be in? (JSON, CSV, API, Visualization)<br>✅ Who are the consumers of the model output? (Humans, ML system, business apps)<br>✅ Should the model provide **explainability** for decisions? |
| **🔹 Data Preprocessing & Storage**<br>✅ How do you ensure **data consistency** across multiple sources?<br>✅ What data storage strategy is best? (SQL, NoSQL, Data Lakes)<br>✅ How frequently should the data be updated or retrained? | **🔹 Model Performance & Evaluation**<br>✅ What evaluation metrics are critical? (Accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, MSE)<br>✅ How should false positives/negatives be handled?<br>✅ Should the system support **real-time feedback loops**? |
| **🔹 Feature Engineering & Representation**<br>✅ What are the most relevant **features** for this task?<br>✅ How do you handle **categorical vs. numerical features**?<br>✅ Should we apply **dimensionality reduction** (PCA, Autoencoders)? | **🔹 Post-Prediction Actions**<br>✅ What happens after the model makes a prediction? (DB storage, alert, automation)<br>✅ How do you prevent incorrect predictions from causing failures?<br>✅ Does the system require **human-in-the-loop** validation? |
