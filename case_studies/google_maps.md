| **Personalized recommendations** (user's historical preferences)                                            | Neural Collaborative Filtering, Two-Tower Network                                                                                | Suggests caf√©s a user might like based on past visits. |

| **Real-time location-aware suggestions** (current location, immediate context) | Multi-Armed Bandits, Reinforcement Learning  | Example: "Low on fuel? Exit in 1 mile for a gas station with the cheapest prices." |
| **Temporal recommendations** (time-related factors)                            | LSTMs, Transformers | Example: "Good morning! Stop by Starbucks for your morning coffee on your way to work." |
